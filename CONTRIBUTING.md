# Contributing to Veggerby.Boards

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Veggerby.Boards**!

This project is a composable .NET board game engine: immutable artifacts (board, tiles, pieces, dice, players), deterministic state transitions, and rule/phase driven flow. Please read these guidelines before submitting code, issues, or documentation.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. **Write clear, focused commits**. Each commit should address a single concern.
3. **Follow the style guide** and `.editorconfig` (spaces, braces, naming, etc.).
4. **Add or update tests** (xUnit + AwesomeAssertions) for all new code and branches (happy, edge, exception).
5. **Document public APIs** with XML docs.
6. **Run** `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` to ensure all checks pass.
7. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description and reference any related issues.

## Project Rules

- **Immutability first**: Artifacts and prior GameStates must never be mutated in place.
- **Deterministic transitions**: Mutators are pure functions from (engine,state,event) ‚Üí new state.
- **Explicit phases**: Game flow changes only through `GamePhase` conditions; no hidden global flags.
- **Small mutators**: One responsibility each; compose rather than branch heavily.
- **No hidden randomness**: Randomness must be injected (e.g., via dice value generators) and testable.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only xUnit + AwesomeAssertions for tests; avoid runtime deps.
- **Clear failure semantics**: Throw specific exceptions (`BoardException`, `InvalidGameEventException`) when invariants break.

See `docs/` (architecture & core concepts) for authoritative model.

## Code Style

- File-scoped namespaces only.
- Braces required for all control flow.
- Spaces only (4 per indent), no tabs.
- Remove unused usings.
- Public: PascalCase, Private: _camelCase.

### Code Style: Non-Negotiables (Fast Reference)

1. File-scoped namespaces only (no nested namespace blocks).
2. Explicit braces for every control flow statement (no single-line implicit bodies).
3. Immutability: never mutate prior `GameState` or artifact state objects; always produce a new snapshot (pure mutators).
4. Determinism: identical prior state + identical event sequence + identical feature flag configuration must yield identical resulting state & hashes.
5. No LINQ in hot paths (rule evaluation loops, pattern/sliding resolution, hashing, mutator inner loops). Allowed in tests and setup code.
6. Allocation discipline: zero allocations on the success path for core movement & rule evaluation (exceptions documented inline with `// STYLE-DEVIATION:`).
7. No hidden global state; feature behavior selected via explicit capabilities or builder composition.
8. Public APIs must have XML docs (invariants documented in `<remarks>`).
9. Tests must follow AAA pattern and cover each new rule branch (Valid / Invalid / Ignore / NotApplicable).
10. Format cleanliness: `dotnet format` should produce no changes before PR.

For the complete authoritative charter (including hot path definition, property test acceptance criteria, and feature flag isolation pattern) see `docs/developer-experience.md`. Any intentional deviation MUST include `// STYLE-DEVIATION:` plus a CHANGELOG entry under Temporary Exceptions.

### Feature Flag Policy

Feature flags represent transitional optimizations or experimental subsystems. To prevent semantic drift and scattered conditional logic:

Policy:

- Express feature differences via capabilities / dependency injection (interfaces, strategy objects) rather than inline `if (FeatureFlags.X)` in business logic.
- Inline flag checks are only acceptable for purely observational code (metrics / trace capture) that cannot alter observable semantics.
- New flag introductions must provide: purpose, default, removal criteria, and parity / performance guard tests.
- Parity tests MUST assert identical outcomes between enabled/disabled modes until the flag graduates (then removal is preferred over permanent branching).

Migration TODO (tracked in backlog): Replace remaining inline `FeatureFlags` conditionals in compiled pattern resolver and fast-path resolution layers with capability abstractions (`IPathResolver` decorators / topology services) to reduce branching and centralize optimization seams.

Deviations:

- Any temporary inline branching requires `// STYLE-DEVIATION:` with rationale and a backlog reference. These must appear in the CHANGELOG Temporary Exceptions section until removed.

### Property / Invariant Tests

All property-style or invariant tests must:

1. Be deterministic (fixed seed / deterministic sequence)
2. Use AAA structuring with clear arrange/act/assert separation
3. Scope feature flags via `FeatureFlagScope` only
4. Avoid LINQ in per-iteration hot loops (allowed in aggregation)
5. Assert both absence of unintended mutation and presence of intended effect
6. Reuse canonical helpers instead of duplicating engine logic
7. Document any tolerated randomness attempts (loop count + rationale)

See `developer-experience.md` Section 12 for the authoritative, versioned list.

## Pull Requests

Include in description:

1. Problem / motivation
2. Approach (new types? new phase? new mutator?)
3. Tests added (list scenarios)
4. Potential regressions / risk
5. Docs updated (yes/no + which files)

## Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue with as much detail as possible.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.

## üöÄ Ways to Contribute

- **Report bugs**: Include reproduction (builder + event sequence).
- **Enhance engine**: New conditions, mutators, event pre-processors.
- **Add a sample game module**: Demonstrate new patterns (hex grid, stacked pieces, etc.).
- **Improve docs**: Clarify phase flow, movement patterns, extension steps.
- **Increase test coverage**: Edge cases (blocked paths, composite phases, ignored events).

## üìã Guidelines

1. **Discuss Larger Changes First** ‚Äì Open an issue for architectural shifts (new phase model, new artifact category).
2. **Keep PRs Focused** ‚Äì One feature or fix; avoid large refactors + new features together.
3. **Tests Required** ‚Äì Each new branch (Valid / Ignore / Invalid) and mutator path.
4. **Style Consistency** ‚Äì File-scoped namespaces, braces always, 4-space indents, no trailing whitespace.
5. **Explain the Why** ‚Äì Problem, approach, test coverage, risks.
6. **No Silent Behavior Changes** ‚Äì Document any altered public semantics (phase resolution, event ordering, etc.).
7. **Performance Mindful** ‚Äì Avoid unnecessary allocations inside hot paths (event handling, phase resolution).

## üõ† Local Setup

- Clone the repository.
- Build the solution (`Veggerby.Boards.sln`) using .NET 9 (primary target) ‚Äî older TFMs may exist for compatibility.
- Run the tests (`Veggerby.Boards.Tests`) before pushing.
- Keep test count and coverage stable or increased.

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet test test/Veggerby.Boards.Tests --configuration Release
```

Optional with coverage (locally):

```bash
dotnet test test/Veggerby.Boards.Tests \
   --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" \
   -- DataCollectionRunSettings.DataCollectors.DataCollector.Configuration.Format=cobertura
```
