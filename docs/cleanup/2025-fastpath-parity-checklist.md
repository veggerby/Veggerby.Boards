# 2025 Fast-Path & DecisionPlan Parity Cleanup Checklist

Status: Draft (internal)
Owner: Engine maintainers

## Purpose

Track remaining gates to fully retire the legacy event traversal and tighten fast-path + compiled resolver responsibilities while preserving determinism.

## Scope

Covers:

- Legacy `HandleEventLegacy` parity validation and removal
- Fast-path metrics + invariant coverage
- Documentation + style reinforcement
- Safe rollback guards

## Invariants

1. Determinism: Same state + event => same resulting state (legacy vs DecisionPlan) while legacy path exists.
2. Metrics Invariant: `Attempts == FastPathHits + CompiledFallback + LegacyFallback + SkippedTotal`.
3. No allocation regressions in hot path (profiling: no new Gen0 per 10k sliding resolutions).
4. No LINQ in `SlidingFastPathResolver` or compiled resolution loop.
5. Legacy handler excluded from RELEASE builds (`#if DEBUG || TESTS`).

## Checklist

- [x] Centralize fast-path metrics ownership in extension (single locus).
- [x] Slim `SlidingFastPathResolver` to pure reconstruction logic.
- [x] Add metrics invariant test (`FastPathMetricsInvariantTests`).
- [x] Conditional compilation wrapper for legacy traversal (`GameProgress.Legacy.cs`).
- [ ] Add dual-run parity test suite asserting zero divergence across curated scenario set (include en passant, castling, promotion, blocked/capture, immobile, no-op events).
- [ ] Add performance regression benchmark comparing (Plan vs Legacy) until removal (extend existing `DecisionPlanVsLegacyBenchmark` with grouping/masking/event-filter variants & allocation counters).
- [ ] Add CI gating step: fail build if parity test diverges (run with `EnableDecisionPlanDebugParity=true`).
- [ ] Add CI grep guard ensuring legacy evaluator symbol absent in Release artifacts.
- [ ] Mark parity feature flag (`EnableDecisionPlanDebugParity`) for removal after 2 consecutive green releases with zero divergence.
- [ ] Remove legacy file and flag blocks (`EnableDecisionPlanDebugParity`).
- [ ] Remove obsolete attribute usages + suppression pragmas tied to legacy traversal.
- [ ] Update docs (architecture + decision plan + action-plan) to drop legacy references / note removal rationale.
- [ ] Final metrics cleanup: drop `LegacyFallback` counter once legacy removed; adjust invariant test accordingly.
- [ ] Add curated sliding fast-path parity pack to CI minimal matrix (already added for fast-path; extend to DecisionPlan parity scenarios if needed).
- [ ] Add analyzer or test asserting no LINQ usage in fast-path & plan scanning loops.
- [ ] Document reentrant `FeatureFlagScope` usage in contributing/testing guide.

## Removal Gates

| Gate | Requirement | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Parity Green Window | 2 stable releases with zero divergence | Pending |
| Benchmark Regression | DecisionPlan p95 <= Legacy p95 + 3% | Pending |
| Test Coverage | 100% branches of fast-path + compiled fallback | Pending |

## Style Reinforcement (applies to all touched files)

- File-scoped namespaces only.
- Explicit braces always.
- 4-space indentation; no tabs.
- Avoid LINQ in hot loops (fast-path + compiled plan scanning).
- Immutability: never mutate `GameState` or `ArtifactState` in-place.
- Deterministic counters (no time-based logic).

## Risk Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Silent metrics drift | Invariant test + future counter delta test |
| Accidental legacy resurrection in Release | Conditional compilation + CI grep check (no symbol) |
| Performance regression hidden | Benchmark job comparing baselines |
| Style drift in hot code | Analyzer rule set (future) + checklist review |

## Actions (Next)

1. Implement curated parity test set (opening positions, en passant, castling, promotion, blocked moves, capture scenarios).
2. Introduce micro-benchmark capturing Attempts/Hit ratio distribution.
3. Add CI script: run parity tests with `EnableDecisionPlanDebugParity=true` and surface mismatch diffs.
4. Schedule removal milestone after gates satisfied.
