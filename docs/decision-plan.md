# DecisionPlan (Experimental)

Status: Experimental (behind `FeatureFlags.EnableDecisionPlan`).

The DecisionPlan is a precompiled linear list of leaf phases (condition + rule). Phase 1 provides parity only.

Enable (before `Compile()`):

```csharp
FeatureFlags.EnableDecisionPlan = true;
```

Goals (Phase 1):

1. Parity with legacy traversal
2. Stable indexes for upcoming observer/tracing

Deferred (later phases): advanced predicate hoisting layers, automatic exclusivity inference, bitmask compression, caching heuristics.

## Current Optimization Stages (Flag-Gated)

All optimizations are opt-in via discrete feature flags to preserve deterministic parity until individually validated.

| Stage | Flag | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Base Plan | `EnableDecisionPlan` | Linear precompiled leaf phase list (parity only) |
| Grouping | `EnableDecisionPlanGrouping` | Collapses contiguous identical state predicate entries; evaluates predicate once per group |
| Event Filtering | `EnableDecisionPlanEventFiltering` | Pre-classifies rules by coarse `EventKind` (e.g., Move, Roll) to skip non-relevant entries early |
| Exclusivity Masks | `EnableDecisionPlanMasks` | Skips later entries whose exclusivity group root already produced an applied rule (mutual exclusion hint) |

### Exclusivity Groups & Masks

Builder API:

```csharp
AddGamePhase("capture-window")
  .Exclusive("combat-cycle")
  .If<NullGameStateCondition>()
  .Then()
    .ForEvent<MovePieceGameEvent>()
    .Then()
      .Do<MovePieceStateMutator>();
```

Semantics:

1. Phases tagged with the same non-null group are declared mutually exclusive candidates.
2. The compiler records two arrays in the plan: `ExclusivityGroups` (group id per entry or null) and `ExclusivityGroupRoots` (index of first occurrence for each entry or -1 when ungrouped).
3. At runtime (when `EnableDecisionPlanMasks` is true) the evaluator tracks which root indices have produced an applied rule for the current event. Subsequent entries mapping to those roots are skipped entirely (predicate, pre-processors, and rule). This reduces redundant predicate evaluations in mutually exclusive families where only the first applicable rule should have effect.
4. Parity: With the mask flag disabled, all entries evaluate as before (no functional change). Tests assert masked vs unmasked correctness (`DecisionPlanMaskingTests`).

Design Notes:

- Exclusivity masking is intentionally conservative (applies only after a rule "applies" not merely evaluates as Valid but then ignored). This preserves semantics in scenarios where multiple exclusive predicates may validate yet only later rules produce state changes.
- A future enhancement may incorporate precondition short-circuit (skip evaluation of predicates once any earlier predicate in the same exclusivity group returns Valid) when proven semantically safe for given rule categories.

Edge Cases:

- Interleaving grouped predicates and exclusivity: masking logic uses root indices so groups inside the same exclusivity root are still visited until an application occurs.
- Nested composites are flattened prior to exclusivity analysis; group ids are compared as opaque strings.

Observability:

- Future work will surface the optimization stage (and masking decisions) via observer trace entries when debug parity mode is introduced.

Disabling the flag reverts to legacy behavior with identical outcomes.

## Metrics

Initial target: â‰¥30% p50 latency reduction on representative move scenarios (Chess opening, Backgammon entry) in Phase 1.
