summary: >-
  Codifies style charter, lint / analyzer cleanliness, deterministic test harness patterns, and benchmark baselines; adds documentation
  modernization. Pending: automated deviation annotation enforcement and perf guard-rail regression budget.
acceptance:
  - Style charter (file-scoped namespaces, braces, immutability) documented & applied in new code.
  - CHANGELOG condensed to net delta format.
  - Benchmarks runnable locally with clear categories (movement, evaluation, sequencing, pattern compile).
  - All public APIs XML documented in touched areas.
open_followups:
  - Analyzer enforcing deviation annotations for approved exceptions.
  - Automated perf baseline comparison (fail on >X% regression in key benchmarks).
  - Docs build lint task (broken anchors, orphan pages).
  - Golden file snapshot tests for rule decision plan serialization.

# Developer Experience & Quality Gates

## Delivered

- Style charter formalized
- CHANGELOG net-delta condensation
- Benchmark suite categorized
- Documentation restructured (core concepts, movement, determinism, performance)
- Manual drift audit (no legacy doc references)

## Pending / Deferred

See open_followups in front matter.

## Risks

Missing automated regression gates may allow silent perf drift; manual deviation tracking not yet enforced.

## Next Steps

Introduce analyzer for deviation annotations then wire perf baseline guard-rail in CI.
