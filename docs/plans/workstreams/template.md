# Workstream Title (CODE-ID)

## Goal

Describe the primary objective and why it matters (determinism, performance, coverage, user value). Avoid implementation detail here.

## Current State Snapshot

Summarize what currently exists (if anything) relevant to this workstream.

## Success Criteria

- Bullet criteria expressing observable outcomes (deterministic, allocation targets, parity tests, etc.).

## Deliverables

1. Deliverable 1
2. Deliverable 2
3. Deliverable 3

## Detailed Task Breakdown (Optional)

| Seq | Task | Description | Output | Risk |
|-----|------|-------------|--------|------|
| 1 | Example | Clarify initial analysis | Notes | Low |

## Risks

- Concise bullet list of real risks (performance regression, complexity, ambiguity).

## Extension Strategy (Optional)

Explain how variants or future scope plug in without bloating baseline implementation.

## Status Summary

Short sentence: Not started / In progress (what done) / Completed.
