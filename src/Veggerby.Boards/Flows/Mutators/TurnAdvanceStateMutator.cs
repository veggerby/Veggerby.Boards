/// Advances the global turn timeline. For non-terminal segments it progresses to the next segment; for the final
/// segment it increments the numeric turn, resets the segment to <see cref="TurnSegment.Start"/>, and (when present)
/// rotates the active player states in player enumeration order.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Player rotation is a compatibility projection for legacy <see cref="ActivePlayerState"/> usage. Once turn
/// sequencing becomes authoritative, legacy active player state may be replaced by a TurnState projection. The
/// mutator only executes when <c>FeatureFlags.EnableTurnSequencing</c> is true and will otherwise return the
/// original <see cref="GameState"/> unchanged. No LINQ is used inside the tight branch except for simple sequencing
/// which is not considered a hot path (turn boundary events are sparse relative to move events).
