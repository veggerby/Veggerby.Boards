/// Decorator that batches high-frequency evaluation callbacks before forwarding to an inner <see cref="IEvaluationObserver"/>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Batching reduces virtual dispatch overhead when many rules are evaluated per event. Ordering across all callbacks for a
/// given handled event is preserved exactly. Flush triggers:
/// 1. Rule applied (success path)
/// 2. Event ignored (no rule applied)
/// 3. Buffer capacity reached (rare fallback)
/// A small struct buffer is used to avoid per-callback allocations. Buffer size chosen to cover common evaluation fan-out.
/// Large plans will segment into multiple flushes but still retain ordering guarantees.
