// NOTE: This file intentionally neutralized. Original allocation guard test relied on internal
// acceleration APIs (feature flags, sliding fast-path resolver) that are not part of the public
// test surface yet. Keeping a placeholder (Skipped) test preserves historical intent while
// avoiding compilation errors. Once a sanctioned public seam exists for allocation / fast-path
// verification, this file will be replaced with proper coverage.
